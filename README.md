# ECommerce Application 
This application demonstrates a small functionality of calculating the total estimated cost of a shopping cart on an e-commerce portal. 
It works with one microservice '**ecommerce-server**' and It deals with 4 SKUs which are inserted into MongoDB as part of the initialisation of the '**ecommerce-server**' service and frontend fetches it at the time of the launch.   

Here is the price list to begin with..
| SKU |    Name     |     Price |
| --- | :---------: | --------: |
| ipd | Super iPad  |  \$549.99 |
| mbp | MacBook Pro | \$1399.99 |
| atv |  Apple TV   |  \$109.50 |
| vga | VGA adapter |   \$30.00 |

Some additional discounts are offered on the launch day!

- The website offers to have a 3 for 2 deal on Apple TVs. For example, if you buy 3 Apple TVs, you will pay the price of 2 only
- The brand new Super iPad will have a bulk discounted applied, where the price will drop to \$499.99 each, if someone buys more than 4
- The website will bundle in a free VGA adapter free of charge with every MacBook Pro sold.
